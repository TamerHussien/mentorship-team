# Node.js Mentorship Program
<p>
 I'm a self-taught Software developer have almost 4 years of experience I was originally working as a mechanical engineer but I have made a career shift to work in this amazing field.

I want to join the program to get more knowledge and contribute to the open-source world and of course, Node.js is one of the most popular and used technology nowadays and this will give me a lot of experience.
